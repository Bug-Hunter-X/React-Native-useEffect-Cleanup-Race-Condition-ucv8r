In React Native, a subtle error can occur when using the `useEffect` hook with asynchronous operations and cleanup functions.  If the cleanup function attempts to access or modify state variables that have already been unmounted, you might encounter errors or unexpected behavior.  This is especially problematic when dealing with network requests or timers that might outlive the component's lifecycle.
